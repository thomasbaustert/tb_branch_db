= TbBranchDb

Rake tasks to Easy-peasy branch a database in your Rails project.

The tasks basically implement the commands describe here:

http://mislav.uniqpath.com/rails/branching-the-database-along-with-your-code/

See the above link for further information about the braching problem and the way it works.

== Requirements

* Git as version control system
* MySQL as database
* Rails (this gem works only inside a Rails project)

== Installation

Add the gem to your bundler Gemfile:

  # Gemfile
  ...
  group :development do
    ...
    gem 'tb_branch_db'
  end

And run:

  $ bundle install

== Usage

First update your config/database.yml to allow branching:

  $ rake db:branch:setup

This will update database.yml like so:

  # config/database.yml
  <%
    # http://mislav.uniqpath.com/rails/branching-the-database-along-with-your-code/
    branch = `git symbolic-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null`.chomp.sub('refs/heads/', '')
    suffix = `git config --bool branch.#{branch}.database`.chomp == 'true' ? "_#{branch}" : ""
  %>
  development:
    ...
    database: onappto_development<%= suffix %>
  ...

Then create a branch (a clone) of your master database:

  $ rake db:branch

This will first create an entry in the .git/config and cloning the master database.

If you want to cleanup the branch run:

  $ rake db:branch:cleanup
